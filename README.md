# DSA Practice  

This repository contains my solved Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems from Striver's A to Z DSA Course and other sources (e.g., LeetCode).

## 📚 What’s inside  

- **Folder-wise categorized solutions**: each major topic in a separate directory.  
- Each file includes:  
  - Problem statement (brief / link)  
  - Solution code (in JavaScript or relevant language)  
  - Time & space complexity analysis  

## ✅ Topics Covered  

| Section / Topic | Description / What’s inside |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Patterns** | Common problem patterns (sliding window, two-pointer, etc.) with solved examples |
| **Basic Mathematics** | Fundamental math-based problems (e.g. primes, modular arithmetic, combinatorics) |
| **Basic Recursion** | Recursion problems: simple recursion, recursion + backtracking, recursion-based problem solving |
| **Hashing** | Frequency counts, hash-map based problems, use of JS built-in hash maps (`Map` / `Object`) for efficient lookups |
| *(Existing/earlier topics)* | [other earlier sections from the course or your practice] |

## 🛠️ How I use this repo  

1. Solve a problem (from Striver’s sheet, LeetCode, or elsewhere).  
2. Place the solution in the appropriate folder.  
3. Add a small comment block at top: problem description / link, complexity analysis.  
4. Commit & push.  

## 📈 Why this repo  

- Helps me track learning progress systematically.  
- Allows easy revisit & revision of old problems.  
- Serves as a portfolio of problem-solving skills.
